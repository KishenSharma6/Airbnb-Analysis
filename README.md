# An Analysis of Airbnb's Growth and Development in San Francisco (10/2018 - 3/2020)

In the following repository, I will be conducting a thorough data analysis of Airbnb data provided by Inside Airbnb.In this analyis, I will explore the following:

* Using the Airbnb calendar data I will explore the growth of the Airbnb over the last 18 months,specifically looking into both the changes in the number of bookings and the total rental income Airbnb was able to generate. I will also forecast Airbnb's growth/decline of the total number of bookings and total rental income in Q2.  

* Using the Airbnb listings data,I am interested in learning more about how Airbnb rental prices are set in San Francisco and what features and ammenities allow for increasing per night rental prices. I would also like to see how rental prices for long-term Airbnb users compare with the local rental market prices.

* Using the Airbnb reviews data, I would like to extract out specific topics from individual user expereinces and compare what about a user's experience led to a really positive reviews vs a really negative review. Using these insights, I would also like to construct a guide for first time Airbnb hosts to better ensure a better user experience for their renters.

* I was inspired to conduct this analysis purely out of curiosity. Airbnb does have a very lucrative model that is disrupting the hotel space and I was curious to see if it could also be a disruptive force in the local housing market.
