# Airbnb-Analysis-NLP-ML-DeepLearning

In this repo, I will be investigating the growth of Airbnb in the San Francisco over the last year or so. I will be investigating the 
following:
- What makes a good user experience?  What makes a poor experience? What would you advise to a new Airbnb host to ensure they receive high review scores?
- Create a price predictor that allows users to set the most fair overnight rental price for their Airbnb listing. What are the most
important features that the model was abe to find? What are some things Airbnb users should deliver to help increase the price of their
listing to keep their prices profitable but also fair?
- How has Airbnb grown over the last year? How has the business grown over the last 2 years? Can you forecast Aribnb performance into the 
next year? 
- Where are the best places to stay in San Francisco? What about the most expensive? When are the best days to visit and what time of year would it be the most affordable to visit?

NLP
- What are some things that hosts makes a positive user experience? What about a negative user experience? What are the commonalities among them within the review data?
- How would you advise a first time Airbnb host to ensure a great user experience? What are some goods/additional services a new host can provide to help ensure continued business on the Airbnb platform?
