In this repo, I will be investigating the growth of Airbnb in the San Francisco over the last 18 months or so. I will be investigating the following:

Listings Data

Where are the best neighborhoods to stay in San Francisco? What about the most expensive? When are the best days to visit and what time of year would it be the most affordable to visit? How many properties are rented for long-term use and how many are being rented for tourists? How much revenue is being generated for these hosts?
How many nights a year is a dwelling occupied on average per month? What months are the most popular for rentals in San Francisco?
I will use Supervised Learning techniques to build a price predictor for a one-night stay in San Francisco. From the model, which features were the most important in deciding the price point? Are these features within the control of an Airbnb host to change (without relocation)?


Calendar Data
How has the number of Airbnb properties changed over the last 18 months? Is their any interesting trends or seasonality? Can you project Airbnbâ€™s growth through Q2 in 2020?

Reviews Data
How many users report having a positive experience with their Airbnb? What about negative? What are the most common topics discussed in the positive reviews as compared to the negative reviews?
How would you advise a first time Airbnb host to ensure a great user experience? What are some goods/additional services a new host can provide to help ensure continued business on the Airbnb platform?

Disclaimers about the data
Data for this analysis was acquired from Inside Airbnb, an independent site that is not associated with or endorsed by Airbnb or any of Airbnb's competitors. The data utilizes public information compiled from the Airbnb web-site including the availability calendar for 365 days in the future, and the reviews for each listing. Data is verified, cleansed, analyzed and aggregated. By analyzing publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings, Inside Airbnb provides filters and key metrics so you can see how Airbnb is being used to compete with the residential housing market.
