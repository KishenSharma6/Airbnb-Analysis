We were a large party of twelve people across three generations (from 68 to 8months) but the accommodation is so versatile that we managed with ease. The house is beautiful, with pretty bedrooms with comfortable beds and quality linens, three luxurious bathrooms with ample towels and quality toiletries provided, a superb kitchen which is very well equipped and satisfied a family of foodies, and stylish living space. There were lots of books and things for the children including beach toys and a kite and racquets and balls for the “bigger kids” who found free courts nearby and staged knockout competitions.  The location is wonderful. The house is in a pretty, quiet street just over the road from Golden Gate park and all that has to offer and a short walk to the beach. There is a large supermarket just a few blocks away and a lively area on Balboa Street with local bakeries and a wealth of eateries and pleasant bars within easy walking distance.  The zoo, which is lovely, is also within easy walking distance. You could happily stay in the immediate locality and keep yourself fully amused.   That said access to the rest of the city is easy with a bus stop on a main arterial route just over the road. MOMA gave us a great day out and the Mission District some great eating experiences. Haight  and Castro were lively and interesting and of course the Golden Gate Bridge! Fisherman’s Wharf was a bit touristy but the museum of animated machines gave us several hours of fun.  Suzy was an absolutely fabulous host. She gave us lots of local information which really helped to orient us in the first few days. The house was beautifully clean and well supplied and we had a welcome pack that was more a welcome banquet. The house was full of plants and flowers and it was good to have a pleasant garden to relax in. Suzy even supplied a gift voucher to get a birthday cake for my 65th Birthday from a local bakery. Her communication was excellent and in the lead up to the holiday she came to feel more like a friend rather than a host.  If you want a lovely place to stay in San Francisco look no further.

Not to mention when I clicked on reserve and clicked on confirm and pay through the Airbnb Website it came up with an error payment didn’t go through. If you don’t want to miss out on the accommodation to click on confirm payment again. But if I hadn’t thought to check my email which confirmed payment then I would of paid double and would still be in this situation oF fighting for my full refund with still no resolution and booking was for Friday, 9th August.   I didn’t cancel with the host as the refund would of only been $169 US so at 12.44am in the morning and less than 48hrs contacted Airbnb Team Support. For over 12 hrs I have had to constantly call Team Support with no end to the resolution. Been hung up by them 7+ times by Case Manager Keith the first one simply spat policy at me and would not transfer me to his supervisors. He also proceeded to ignore my calls and emails and was promised he would call me back but only attempted to call apparently when I was yet again called Team Support then I received an email.   Every time I asked to speak to a Case Managers supervisor they hung up on me blaming it on computer issues also unable to transfer me to the Case Manager dealing with my matter - every call. That is the reason for so many Case Managers I had gone through. At 4am in the morning spoke to Hazel who mentioned she would reach out to the host on my behalf requesting a refund. However was never emailed updates and where my case is at.   And so it seems Airbnb like to push the blame and responsibility on the host as to whether I would receive a refund however the host was only concerned with losing the money that he refused to provide a full refund. At this point having a aleepless night moved around 7+ Case Managers from Manila all not prepared to do anything, Spitting policy at me.   And not willing to resolve my issue. Tired and frustrated waiting for call back after call back from Case Managers, Supervisors wanting my money back for accommodation which was only for 1 nights stay instead of the 2 nights I thought I’d booked.   I’m still no closer to resolving the matter as now the Supervisor from Resolutions Team is yet to call me back and it’s been 2 days passed.   I am frustrated, disappointed, disgusted at the outrageously horrible customer service I have experienced from everyone I’ve dealt with at Airbnb Team Support and the Host who also only worried about losing their money and spat policy at me but not concerned about a overseas traveller trying to enjoy her international experience and save money along the way where I can.   I will continue to fight for my refund and will no longer be using Airbnb again because of the disgraceful way they continue to handle my case.   Disappointed customer, Zarita</td>\n",

If you don’t want to miss out on the accommodation to click on confirm payment again. But if I hadn’t thought to check my email which confirmed payment then I would of paid double and would still be in this situation oF fighting for my full refund with still no resolution and booking was for Friday, 9th August.   I didn’t cancel with the host as the refund would of only been $169 US so at 12.44am in the morning and less than 48hrs contacted Airbnb Team Support.

I felt very comfortable living at Anjan’s for a week and I really enjoyed staying there.            If you’re a respectful person and are looking for a place to stay in SF for a short time, I highly recommend staying at Anjan’s. He’s a great person and a great host.   2013-06-02   \n",
