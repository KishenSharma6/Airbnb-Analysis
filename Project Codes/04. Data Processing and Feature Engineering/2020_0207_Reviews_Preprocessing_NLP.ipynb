Sharna said no.  But it turned out that her second floor condo was actually on the third floor and required my husband to climb 50 steps to get to our bedroom!     Key problems: First, rang the doorbell (which didn’t work). After we banged for a while on the outside door, Sharna appeared. No smile or hello. She told us she was in the middle of a phone call and would soon come back down to help with baggage. She gave us a set of keys that didn’t work. So we went back to ringing the inoperative doorbell &amp; banging on the door until Sharna came down again.  When I told her that three different people were unable to open the door, she denied it &amp; said no one else had ever had difficulty in using them.  I asked her what to do if we couldn't open the door. Sharna’s response: “I don’t know what to tell you.”  Finally I asked if she had another set of keys.  She did, and this set worked.  Sharna continued to argue that the doorbell did in fact work, but I gave up on arguing with her.        We climbed the 50 steps, with my husband increasingly exhausted. The bed was very comfortable, but there was a dresser filled with Sharna’s things and no decent chair to sit in.  Since we were booked for 7 days, I asked her for the use of a dresser.  She didn’t offer to clear out the dresser but asked instead how many drawers we needed.     Sharna told us that a cleaner came once a week but didn’t change the sheets.     Sharna told us that she was going off –to LA, I think, and that we would have the place to ourselves.     After she left, we discovered that the bed sheet and the pillowcase had reddish brown stains on them. There was no bath mat in the shower (so my husband, who has balance problems, couldn’t use it).  The two tiny wastebaskets were unlined, and the carpet had dirt stains on it.      If Jim and I were l0 years younger, we would have immediately made plans to move.  But we were exhausted, and thought that getting a new place would take time away from our plans to meet our friends and relatives in and around the city.     Sharna’s place wasn’t exactly a condo from hell – but it came close.  As for Sharna, I would rate her hosting abilities as close to zero (no stars).  She was unkind, indifferent, unhelpful and dishonest about the 50 stair 3rd floor condo.      Esther and Jim</td>\n",

There was a bunch of crunchy things and hair on the sheets and pillow case. The top sheet was torn in several places and the pillow cases had holes in them. They were not changed. I had no place to stay so I brushed them off and spent two uncomfortable nights in the house.       The bathtub/shower was dirty and had black mold around where the wall met the tub. The sink was dirty and I mean they hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The toilet was filthy inside and out. The little plastic container to put my bathroom stuff in on the counter was gross. I would never have put my toothpaste and toothbrush in it.        There is no heat in the house and it was 52 degrees at night. I went to Walgreens and purchased a small heater to use at night for the two nights I stayed there.        I was offered coffee when I woke up so I went out to the kitchen and there was barely one cup left in the machine. I was the only person at the house and I guess a quarter pot to share with the owner is all you get. I was very disappointed. I would never stay there again or recommend it to anyone</td>\n",

She told us she was in the middle of a phone call and would soon come back down to help with baggage. She gave us a set of keys that didn’t work. So we went back to ringing the inoperative doorbell & banging on the door until Sharna came down again.  When I told her that three different people were unable to open the door, she denied it & said no one else had ever had difficulty in using them.  I asked her what to do if we couldn't open the door. Sharna’s response: “I don’t know what to tell you.”  Finally I asked if she had another set of keys.  She did, and this set worked.  Sharna continued to argue that the doorbell did in fact work, but I gave up on arguing with her.        We climbed the 50 steps, with my husband increasingly exhausted. The bed was very comfortable, but there was a dresser filled with Sharna’s things and no decent chair to sit in.  Since we were booked for 7 days, I asked her for the use of a dresser.  She didn’t offer to clear out the dresser but asked instead how many drawers we needed.     Sharna told us that a cleaner came once a week but didn’t change the sheets.     Sharna told us that she was going off –to LA, I think, and that we would have the place to ourselves.     After she left, we discovered that the bed sheet and the pillowcase had reddish brown stains on them. There was no bath mat in the shower (so my husband, who has balance problems, couldn’t use it).  The two tiny wastebaskets were unlined, and the carpet had dirt stains on it.      If Jim and I were l0 years younger, we would have immediately made plans to move.  But we were exhausted, and thought that getting a new place would take time away from our plans to meet our friends and relatives in and around the city.     Sharna’s place wasn’t exactly a condo from hell – but it came close.  As for Sharna, I would rate her hosting abilities as close to zero (no stars).  She was unkind, indifferent, unhelpful and dishonest about the 50 stair 3rd floor condo.      Esther and Jim          \n",

The first thing I do anywhere is pull back the top sheet. There was a bunch of crunchy things and hair on the sheets and pillow case. The top sheet was torn in several places and the pillow cases had holes in them. They were not changed. I had no place to stay so I brushed them off and spent two uncomfortable nights in the house.       The bathtub/shower was dirty and had black mold around where the wall met the tub. The sink was dirty and I mean they hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The toilet was filthy inside and out. The little plastic container to put my bathroom stuff in on the counter was gross. I would never have put my toothpaste and toothbrush in it.        There is no heat in the house and it was 52 degrees at night. I went to Walgreens and purchased a small heater to use at night for the two nights I stayed there.        I was offered coffee when I woke up so I went out to the kitchen and there was barely one cup left in the machine. I was the only person at the house and I guess a quarter pot to share with the owner is all you get. I was very disappointed. I would never stay there again or recommend it to anyone      \n",

Quiet neighborhood up on the hill close enough to walk although I do suggest you take a car service home after cause some of those SF hills are brutal after a long day. Only thing that was  kinda a bummer was the shower water pressure is non existent after a long day in the city. Overall though, nice small place to stay if you plan on being out in the city most of the time which you should be doing anyway cause your on vacation!   \n",
